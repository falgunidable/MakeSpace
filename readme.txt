A platform which will help solve the problem of used goods stored in household and is no longer needed. A problem that tells us about space occupancy being an important part of oneâ€™s life.

Space is an important factor when home is being considered. A planned space will lead to much less visible clutter in your home. Maybe you will still have a lot of things that are really not needed but they need not sit in unseemly piles around your home. More organized. One might not be able to find a particular thing just when you need it around the house. It makes your home an ideal one. We should declutter our homes, as they are always piled with stocks of unwanted and useless things. Second hand goods are found in each and every house. Some like to store things, while other try to get rid of it. My website focuses on products which can be sold either by selling it online by entering its details or by selling it directly to a shop by uploading the image of the product and getting a nearby shop. With this terms and conditions are also shown for transparency with the seller and buyer. The buyer can sell items accordingly and chat with the seller accordingly. Through this I can help gain maximum utilization of space and build trust on both sides.
